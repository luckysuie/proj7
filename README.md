## Features

This project framework provides the following features:

* Modern .NET application architecture with .NET Aspire
* Various search capabilities (keyword search, semantic search)
* Integration with multiple AI models (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, etc.)
* Vector database implementations (In Memory, Azure AI Search, Chroma DB and others)
* Real-time audio capabilities
* Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and client implementation

## eShopLite Scenarios

The project includes several scenarios demonstrating different capabilities:

| Scenario | Description | Key Technologies |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| [01 - Semantic Search](./scenarios/01-SemanticSearch/) | A reference .NET application implementing an eCommerce site with Search features using Keyword Search and Semantic Search. | .NET Aspire, OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, In-memory Vector DB |
| [02 - Azure AI Search](./scenarios/02-AzureAISearch/) | Implements an eCommerce site with Keyword Search using SQL queries and Semantic Search with Vector Database and Azure AI Search. | Azure AI Search, OpenAI Embeddings, SQL Server |
| [03 - Realtime Audio](./scenarios/03-RealtimeAudio/) | Extends the eCommerce site with advanced search features and real-time audio capabilities powered by the GPT-4o Realtime Audio API. | GPT-4o Realtime Audio API, Audio in Blazor, .NET Aspire |
| [04 - Chroma DB](./scenarios/04-chromadb/) | Implements semantic search functionality using Chroma DB, an open-source database designed for AI applications. | Chroma DB, OpenAI Embeddings, .NET SDK |
| [05 - DeepSeek-R1](./scenarios/05-deepseek/) | Demonstrates integration of the DeepSeek-R1 model for enhanced semantic understanding and search capabilities. | DeepSeek-R1, .NET Aspire, Vector Embeddings |
| [06 - Model Context Protocol (MCP)](./scenarios/06-mcp/) | Implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for advanced AI interactions with MCP Servers and MCP Clients. | Model Context Protocol, Function Calling, SSE Events |
| [07 - Agents Concurrent](./scenarios/07-AgentsConcurrent/) | Demonstrates concurrent agent orchestration and advanced AI agent collaboration patterns. | .NET Aspire, Multi-Agent Systems, Orchestration |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 9](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/)
- [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://aka.ms/install-azd) (for Azure deployment)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/eShopLite.git
   ```

1. Navigate to the scenario directory of interest:
   ```bash
   cd eShopLite/scenarios/[scenario-folder]
   ```

1. Login to Azure:

    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```

1. Provision and deploy all the resources:

    ```shell
    azd up
    ```

    It will prompt you to provide an `azd` environment name (like "eShopLite"), select a subscription from your Azure account, and select a [location where the necessary models, like gpt-4o-mini and ADA-002 are available](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=cognitive-services&regions=all), a sample region can be "eastus2".

### Quickstart

1. Navigate to a specific scenario folder (e.g., `scenarios/01-SemanticSearch/`)
2. Follow the README instructions in that scenario folder
3. Run the solution using `dotnet run` in the appropriate host project folder

## Demo

To run the demo, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the specific scenario folder
2. Follow the "Run the solution" instructions in that scenario's README
3. Access the application via the URLs provided in the console output
